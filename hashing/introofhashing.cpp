//in hashing it provide search ,delete ,insert all three operations in big(o)of 1 time.
//so we have set of keys for example a set of phone numbers -> you want to quickly find a details of a person with given phone nno. is (search)
//you want to insert a new phone number as a key and value as details of that person this is (insertion) 
//if phone number already exist then this insertion override the previous value

////// In hashtable and hashing we always have unique value so we instert same key then it overight the previous 

//delete is simple we delete a key and it's corresponding value from the hash table
//it beats array and avl and redblack tree because of log n if n is very high
